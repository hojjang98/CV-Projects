# ðŸ§  Deep Learning for Vision Systems â€“ Personal Reimplementation Notebooks

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks inspired by the concepts in  
**"Deep Learning for Vision Systems"** by Mohamed Elgendy.

Rather than following the book line-by-line, I have **read the full book** and now use it  
as a reference point to **implement ideas in my own way** â€” through custom datasets,  
modified architectures, and experimentation-driven learning.

> âœ… Book reading completed. This repo is for reinterpretation and reimplementation.

## ðŸ§ª What This Is

- ðŸ“Œ This is **not** a reproduction of the book's official code  
- ðŸš« This is **not** a chapter-by-chapter copy  
- âœ… This is my **own series of implementations**, grounded in the theory from the book

Each notebook represents a unique take on concepts like:

- CNN design and tweaking  
- Transfer learning in new domains  
- Augmentation and preprocessing pipelines  
- Visualization and model evaluation  
- Building pipelines from scratch, not following templates

## ðŸ“š Reference

- **Book**: *Deep Learning for Vision Systems* by Mohamed Elgendy  
- **Original GitHub**: [github.com/AppliedDataSciencePartners/deep-learning-vision-systems](https://github.com/AppliedDataSciencePartners/deep-learning-vision-systems)

This repository reflects a **personal reinterpretation** of ideas for deeper understanding  
and hands-on mastery.

## ðŸš€ Goals

Through this work, I aim to:

- Strengthen my understanding by building from scratch  
- Explore variations beyond what the book provides  
- Use **realistic image data** I collected myself  
- Develop reusable patterns for future CV tasks  
- Document insights and struggles throughout the process

More content will be added as I revisit and reinterpret each major idea.
