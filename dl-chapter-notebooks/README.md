# ðŸ§  Deep Learning for Vision Systems â€“ Chapter Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks implemented while studying  
**"Deep Learning for Vision Systems"** by Mohamed Elgendy.

Each notebook corresponds to hands-on exercises or architecture implementations inspired by chapters in the book.

> âœ… Currently studied up to **page 260** (and counting!)
